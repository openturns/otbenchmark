        Create a Borgonovo sensitivity problem.

        The function is defined by the equation:

        g(x) = x1 * x2 + x3

        where x1, x2, x3 ~ U(0, 1).

        The input random variables are independent.

        Example
        -------
        problem  = BorgonovoSensitivity()

        Analysis
        --------

        The dimension and parameters of this problem cannot be changed.
        The Sobol' sensitivity indices are exact.

        The model was first introduced in (Borgonovo, 2017).
