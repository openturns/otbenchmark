    def __init__(self, name, thresholdEvent, probability):
        """
        Create a reliability problem.

        The essential information is the exact probability.
        This should be as accurate as possible.
        The best possible accuracy for a Python float is 53 significant
        (binary) bits, which approximately corresponds to 15-17 decimal digits.
        If this accuracy is not available, then a reference value may be used,
        for example from a large Monte-Carlo sample.

        In general, the exact probability should be a constant value,
        e.g. 0.123456789.
        However, we may be forced to compute this probability at the creation
        of the problem, for example if the threshold of the problem
        can be set at the creation of the object.
        In this case, the unit test must check that the default value of the
        parameters correspond to a reference, constant, value.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : str
            The name of the benchmark problem.
            This is a short string, typically less than a dozen of caracters.

        thresholdEvent : ot.ThresholdEvent
            The event.

        probability : float
            The exact probability.
