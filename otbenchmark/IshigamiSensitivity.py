        Create a Ishigami sensitivity problem.

        The function is defined by the equation:

        g(x) = sin(X1) + a * sin(X2)^2 + b * X3^4 * sin(X1)

        where X1, X2, X3 in Uniform([-pi, pi]).
        The input random variables are independent.

        Parameters
        ----------
        a : float
            The first parameter.

        b : float
            The second parameter.

        Example
        -------
        problem  = IshigamiSensitivity()

        Analysis
        --------

        The dimension of this problem cannot be changed, but
        its parameters can.
        The Sobol' sensitivity indices are computed from the values
        of the parameters.

        The distribution of the output of the Ishigami function has two modes.

        The first order indice of X3 is equal to zero and the total order
        indice of X3 is strictly posititive: the variable X3 has an influence on the
        output only through its interaction with X1.

        The detailed analysis is the following.
        * The variable X1 has a total indice close to 0.6 has the
        highest impact on the output variability, by X1 on its own or
        by its interactions with other variables.
        Indeed, its first order indice is close to 0.3, which
        implies that interactions of X1 with other variables are involved
        in 0.6 - 0.3 = 0.3 of the variability of the output.
        * The variable X2 has a first order indice approximately equal to 0.4,
        which is close to the total order indice.
        This shows that this variable does not interact with other variables.
        * The variable X3 has a first order indice equal to zero.
        Since its total order indice is approximately equal to 0.3,
        this shows that its impact on the output is only through its
        interaction with X1.

        The function was first introduced in (Ishigami, Homma, 1990).
