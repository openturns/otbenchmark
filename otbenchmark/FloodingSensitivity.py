        Create a Flooding sensitivity problem.

        The function is defined by the equation:

        g(x) = (Q/(Ks*B*sqrt((Zm-Zv)/L)))^(3.0/5.0)+Zv-Zb-Hd

        where:

            Q : maximum annual flowrate (m3/s)
            Ks : Strickler coefficient
            Zv : downstream riverbed level (m)
            Zm : upstream riverbed level (m)
            L : Length of the river in meters
            B : Width of the river in meters
            Hd : height of the dyke (m)
            Zb : the height of the bank (m)

        The input random variables are independent.

        Parameters
        ----------
        None.

        Example
        -------
        problem  = FloodingSensitivity()

        Analysis
        --------

        The dimension of this problem cannot be changed.

        The model was first introduced in (Iooss, 2015).

        The analysis is the following.

        * The model has almost no interactions.
        * The most important variable is Q, with first order indice
        approximately equal to 0.4.
        * The variables L and B are insignificant.

        The reference Sobol' indices were computed from a sparse
        polynomial chaos.
        A Sobol' low discrepancy design of experiments was generated
        with 1000 training points.
        The sparse polynomial chaos expansion used an hyperbolic enumeration
        rule and a polynomial degree 8.
        The coefficients were estimated from regression.
        With 1000  points in the validation set, the Q2 was greater than 99.9%.
        There are 2 significant digits in the reference results.
