# otbenchmark

## What is it?

The goal of this project is to provide benchmark classes for OpenTURNS. 
It provides a framework to create use-cases which are associated with
reference values.
Such a benchmark problem may be used in order to check that a given
algorithm works as expected and to measure its performance in terms 
of accuracy and speed.

Two categories of benchmark classes are currently provided:
* reliability problems, i.e. estimating the probability that 
the output of a function is less than a threshold,
* sensitivity problems, i.e. estimating sensitivity indices, 
for example Sobol' indices.

Most of the reliability problems were adapted from the RPRepo

https://rprepo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

This module allows you to create a problem, run an algorithm and 
compare the computed probability with a reference probability: 
Moreover, we can loop over all problems and run several methods on these 
problems.
